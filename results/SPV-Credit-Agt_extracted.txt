provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (1) the

any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the

may not assign or otherwise transfer (including through participation) any of its rights or
obligations as Managing Member or its Membership Interest in Borrower without the

void). All assignments permitted hereunder shall be effected pursuant to documentation
reasonably satisfactory to the Controlling Party. From and after the date of effectiveness

thereunder shall be a party hereto and have the rights and obligations of the assigning
Lender under this Agreement (to the extent of the interest so assigned) and the other Loan
Documents, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (to the extent of the interest so assigned) and, to the extent the
entire amount of its Loans have been assigned or transferred, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.05.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at no time shall there be more than 75 Lenders. Any
30
(NY) 07865/007/LLC/SPV.Credit.Agreement.doc

assignment or transfer by a Lender or the Controlling Party of rights or obligations under
this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.06 shall be null and void.
Section 9.07. Subordination. (a) All Obligations owing to the Subordinated
Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including in respect of principal
and interest (including Contingent Interest) on the Subordinated Loans) (subject to
subsection (p) below, collectively, the “Junior Debt”) are subordinate and junior in right
of payment to all the Obligations owing to the Senior Lender hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents (including in respect of principal and interest on the Senior Loans,
but excluding the Contingent Interest) (subject to subsection (p) below, collectively, the
“Senior Debt”) to the extent and in the manner provided herein and in the Security
Agreement.
(b) The Borrower shall not, directly, or indirectly, make or agree to make any
payment (in cash or property, by set-off or otherwise), direct or indirect, except in
accordance with the Waterfall.
(c) Upon (i) any acceleration of the principal amount due on any Junior Debt or
(ii) any payment or distribution of assets of the Borrower of any kind or character,
whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution or winding up or
total or partial liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower, whether voluntary or
involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other statutory or common law
proceedings or arrangements, then and in any such event all principal and interest and all
other amounts due or to become due upon the Senior Debt shall first be paid in full in
cash before the Subordinated Lender shall be entitled to retain any assets so paid or
distributed in respect of the Junior Debt (for principal, interest or otherwise); and, upon
any such dissolution or winding up or liquidation or reorganization, any payment or
distribution of assets of the Borrower of any kind or character, whether in cash, property
or securities, to which the Subordinated Lender would be entitled, except as otherwise
provided herein, shall be paid by the Borrower or by any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy,
liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, or by the
Subordinated Lender if received by them, to the Collateral Agent for distribution to the
Senior Lender, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Debt in full in cash, after giving
effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the Senior Lender, before any
payment or distribution is made to the Subordinated Lender.
(d) Until the Senior Debt shall have been paid in full in cash, the Subordinated
Lender irrevocably authorizes and empowers (without imposing any obligation on) the
Senior Lender and its representatives, under the circumstances set forth in paragraph (c)
above, to demand, sue for, collect and receive every such payment or distribution
described therein and give acquittance therefor and to file claims and proofs of claims in
any statutory or nonstatutory proceeding. The Subordinated Lender shall execute and
deliver to the Senior Lender and its representatives all such further instruments
confirming the foregoing authorization, and all such powers of attorney, proofs of claim,
assignments of claim and other instruments, and shall take all such other action as may be
31
(NY) 07865/007/LLC/SPV.Credit.Agreement.doc

requested by the Senior Lender or its representatives in order to enable the Senior Lender
to enforce all claims upon or in respect of the Junior Debt.
(e) Until the Senior Debt shall have been paid in full in cash, should any
payment or distribution be collected or received by the Subordinated Lender, the
Subordinated Lender shall forthwith turn over the same to the Collateral Agent in the
form received (except for the endorsement or the assignment of the Subordinated Lender
when necessary) and, until so turned over, the same shall be held in trust by the
Subordinated Lender as the property of the Senior Lender.
(f) The Subordinated Lender shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Controlling Party, institute any proceedings to enforce, the Junior Debt until the Senior
Debt is paid in full in cash. For the avoidance of doubt, no payments may be made by the
Borrower in respect of the Junior Debt except as permitted by the Waterfall.
(g) Until the Senior Debt shall have been paid in full in cash, the Subordinated
Lender agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the Controlling Party,
commence or join with or facilitate any other Person in commencing any proceeding
against the Borrower or any other Person under any bankruptcy, reorganization,
readjustment of debt, dissolution, receivership, liquidation or insolvency law or statute
now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction, nor shall the Subordinated Lender, without
the prior written consent of the Controlling Party participate in any assignment for the
benefit of creditors, compositions, or arrangements with respect to the Borrower’s debts.
(h) Subject to the payment in full in cash of all Senior Debt, the Subordinated
Lender shall be subrogated to the rights of the Senior Lender to receive payments or
distributions of assets of the Borrower made on the Senior Debt until the Junior Debt
shall be paid in full in cash.
(i) The above provisions are not intended to impair as between the Borrower,
its creditors other than the Senior Lender, and the Subordinated Lender, the obligation of
the Borrower, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Subordinated Lender the
Subordinated Loans, as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance
with its terms, principal and interest thereon, subject to the rights of the Senior Lender as
provided in the above provisions, or to affect the relative rights of the Subordinated
Lender and other creditors of the Borrower, other than the Senior Lender.
(j) Application of the foregoing provisions to the Junior Debt, the
subordination effected thereby and the rights of the Senior Lender shall not be affected by
(i) any permitted amendment of or addition or supplement to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or any Senior Debt or any instrument or agreement relating thereto or
providing collateral security for any Senior Debt, (ii) any exercise or non-exercise of any
right, power or remedy under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or any Senior Debt or any instrument or agreement relating thereto, or any
release of any collateral securing any Senior Debt, or (iii) any permitted waiver, consent,
release, indulgence, extension, renewal, modification, delay or any other action, inaction
32
(NY) 07865/007/LLC/SPV.Credit.Agreement.doc

or omission in respect of this Agreement or any Security Document or any Senior Debt or
any instrument or agreement relating thereto or providing collateral security for any
Senior Debt; in each case whether or not the Subordinated Lender shall have had notice
or knowledge of any of the foregoing.
(k) Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Borrower, the
Subordinated Lender shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree entered by any
court of competent jurisdiction in which an insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership,
liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, winding up or similar case or proceeding is
pending, or a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee,
custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other Person making such
payment or distribution, delivered to the Subordinated Lender, for the purpose of
ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the Senior
Lender and other Indebtedness of the Borrower, the amount thereof or payable thereon,
the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto.
(l) The Subordinated Lender hereby waives notice of or proof of reliance by
the Senior Lender upon the provisions hereof, and the Senior Debt shall conclusively be
deemed to have been created, contracted, incurred or maintained in reliance upon the
provisions hereof.
(m) The Borrower hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand, protest and
notice of any kind whatsoever. The non-exercise by the Controlling Party or the
Collateral Agent of any of its rights hereunder or under any Security Document in any
particular instance shall not constitute a waiver thereof in that or any subsequent instance.
(n) The subordination provisions contained herein are for the benefit of the
Senior Lender and its successors and assigns and may not be rescinded or cancelled or
modified in any way without the prior written consent of the Controlling Party.
(o) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 9.07, nothing in this
Section 9.07 shall in any manner be deemed or interpreted so as to restrict any payment
to the Subordinated Lender otherwise authorized by the Waterfall.
(p) Consistent with the Waterfall, interest on the Senior Debt is senior only to
interest on the Junior Debt and not to principal of the Junior Debt.
Section 9.08. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said
counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.
Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by email or facsimile
transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. A
set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the
Borrower, each Lender and the Controlling Party.

unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Section 9.10. Integration. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
represent the entire agreement of the Borrower, the Lenders and the Controlling Party
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises,

contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the obligations of the
Borrower under this Agreement and all other Transaction Documents are solely the
obligations of the Borrower and shall be payable solely to the extent of funds received by

Transaction Document against any holder of a membership interest, employee, officer or
Affiliate thereof and, except as specifically provided herein and in the other Transaction

Agreement against the Administrator, the Investment Manager or any holder of the
membership interests of the Borrower or any Related Party of any thereof; provided that
the foregoing shall not relieve any such person or entity from any liability they might
otherwise have as a result of willful misconduct, gross negligence or fraudulent actions
taken or omissions by them or, in the case of the Administrator or the Investment
Manager or any Related Party thereof, the foregoing or its negligence in the performance
of its duties under the Administration Agreement or the Investment Manager Agreement,
as the case may be. The provisions of this Section 9.16 shall survive the termination or
expiration of this Agreement and the Obligations.
Section 9.17. Certain Tax Matters. It is the intention of the parties that for U.S.
federal income tax purposes the Borrower shall be treated as the owner of the Collateral.
The terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents shall be interpreted
consistently with this intention and neither the Borrower nor any holder of either a Senior
Loan or a Subordinated Loan shall take a contrary position for any tax purpose, except as
required by law. No election under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 shall be
made that the Borrower be classified as a corporation.
Section 9.18. Additional Inspection Rights. At all times while any Subordinated
Loans are outstanding, each of the Borrower and the Managing Member (solely in its
capacity as such) shall permit (i) the Subordinated Lender and its agents, consultants,
contractors and advisors, (ii) the Special Inspector General of the Troubled Asset Relief
Program, and (iii) the Comptroller General of the United States access to personnel and
any books, papers, records or other data (other than any of the foregoing to the extent

containing unredacted information regarding the identities of the borrowers of TALF
Loans) delivered to it pursuant to the Transaction Documents or otherwise in its
possession, custody or control (in the case of the Managing Member, solely in its
capacity as such), in each case to the extent relevant to ascertaining compliance with the
terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Documents, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable notice to the Borrower or the Managing Member, as the case may be;
provided that prior to disclosing any information pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii), the
Subordinated Lender, the Special Inspector General of the Troubled Asset Relief
Program and the Comptroller General of the United States shall have agreed, with respect
to documents obtained under this agreement in furtherance of their respective functions,
to follow applicable law and regulation (and the applicable customary policies and
procedures, including those for inspectors general) regarding the dissemination of
confidential materials, including redacting confidential information from the public
version of its reports, as appropriate, and soliciting input from the Borrower as to
information that should be afforded confidentiality. The Subordinated Lender represents
that it has been informed by the Special Inspector General of the Troubled Asset Relief
Program and the Comptroller General of the United States that they, before making any
request for access or information pursuant to their oversight and audit functions, will
establish a protocol to avoid, to the extent reasonably possible, duplicative requests.
Nothing in this Section 9.18 shall be construed to limit the authority that the Special
Inspector General of the Troubled Asset Relief Program or the Comptroller General of
the United States have under law.
Section 9.19. Authority for Subordinated Loan Commitment. The Borrower, the
Senior Lender and the Subordinated Lender acknowledge and agree that the Subordinated
Loan Commitment is hereby made by the Subordinated Lender pursuant to the authority
granted to it by and under EESA.
